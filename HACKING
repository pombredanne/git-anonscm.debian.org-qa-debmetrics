Debmetrics Contribution Guidelines

Prerequisites
=============

You need git to clone the repository. In Debian, git is provided by "git".
You also need Python 3.

Project Overview
================

The goal of Debian Metrics Portal is to provide an iterface for viewing,
adding, and maintaining metrics in a uniform way.

Communication
=============

For now, you can just email Joseph at joseph.bisch@gmail.com.

Getting the Code
================

You can get a copy of the latest code with this command:

    git clone git://anonscm.debian.org/qa/debmetrics.git
    cd debmetrics

To get updates (as long as you haven't committed changes to master) run this
command:

    git pull

Style Guide
===========

Follow PEP 8[0]. In particular, be sure to indent 4 spaces and use spaces
instead of tabs. Limit lines to 79 characters.

Getting JS and css files
========================

3rd party JS and css files were excluded from this repo, but are necessary to
take full advantage of the web interface.

It is recommended that you use minified_grabber to download 3rd party JS and
css.
