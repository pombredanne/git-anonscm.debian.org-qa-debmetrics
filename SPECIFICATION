Debian Metrics Portal

Description
===========

Create a Debian Metrics Portal to view, add, and maintain metrics in a 
uniform way. 

Benefits to Debian
==================

Make it easier to improve Debian by providing a single source of metrics to 
evaluate changes.

Data Sources
============

For now we will focus on the following data sources:

- BTS stats including important bugs and old bugs. Important bugs are those
 that have a major effect on the usability of a package, making it completely
 unusable. Old bugs are bugs older than 2 years. Old bugs may either have just
 been neglected or the bug report might not be detailed enough. It is important
 to display these in such a way as to make the data accessable.

- Release-critical means that a bug affects the release of the package with the
 stable release of Debian. It is important to graph the total number of RC bugs
 and also the packages with the most RC bugs to show how close a release is to
 being RC bug free and which packages need the most attention. 

- Dpkg-formats - List and graph the total number of packages that use each
 format. Can use to figure out why there is so much 3.0 (native) and 1.0
 format usage. Possibly can correlate with packages with missing maintainers,
 undermaintained packages.

- Source code stats - Display statistics about the number of lines and size
 of releases and various packages. Important to identify changes in number of
 lines and in size between releases so we can identify where increased size
 comes from. 

- VCS-usage - List and graph the total number of packages that use each VCS.
 Proves that git is most popular VCS in Debian. Allows us to look into trends
 in VCS usage and see how tools can be improved to encourage use of git over
 other VCS.

Choice of Libraries
===================

- jinja2
  - templating engine
- flot
  - JS graphing library
- SQLAlchemy
  - ORM
- flask
  - web framework
- marshmallow
  - object to JSON serializer
- Alembic
  - model versioning

Data Format
===========

Flot expects something like the following format:

{
  "coords": [{"data": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], "label": "Label1"},
             {"data": [[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...], "label": "Label2"}]
}

Then you can use the following snippet:

var json = (function () {
    var json = null;
    $.ajax({
        'async': false,
        'global': false,
        'url': "dump.json",
        'dataType': "json",
        'success': function (data) {
            json = data;
        }
    });
    return json;
})();
plot = $("#placeholder").plot(json["coords"], { 
    ...
    ...
    ...
}).data("plot");

TO BE ADDED

Interface
=========

1) Local metrics

Run on machine hosting the metrics portal. Client provides a script via 
push interface (POST to some URL with an api key).

2) Remote metrics

Run remote script located at some URL. Outputs data as json or xml as predefined 
by the client. Metrics portal parses it into standard format as described in 
Data Format.

3) Manifest file

A manifest file is uploaded by the client to tell the metrics portal information 
about when to run scripts and the format of the output.

sample format (ConfigParser):

[script1]
output = local|remote
deps = dep1, dep2, dep3, ... # optional
freq = min hour dom month dow year # crontab format
url = http://www.example.com/script # for remote metrics; don't include for local
tablename = Name
fields = field1, field2, field3, ... # ts is field, but isn't defined by client
format = json|xml

[script2]
output = local|remote
...
...
...
